# scraper_yapo21-ver2
Ver. 2 of scraper_yapo21

This project correspond to a newer, better version of scraper_yapo21. It comes with some extra error-handling functions and options, to prevent errors specifically during the data writing. 

I'm also uploading the database of its first complete execution, which took for place for about 4 hours, scraping sucessfully 50.000 sales sites. Data is not ready to be used by any visualization or statistical software yet. It's the raw version, so be free to use it as you're already warned about it's data quality (though the data is real).

Let me know if you have any comments. A lot of python flaws might be present in my code since i'm not a coder perse, i'm always learning in the way.
